Microsoft Paint Robot Project

Research Notes

*I'll probably delete this section of the ReadMe once the project is finished. Just notes to myself*

MSPaint.exe does not accept any command line arguments apart from the file. You can only specify the file to be opened.

I've noticed when re-opening paint, the last image size is still used. For example, 500x500 if the last image edited was 500x500. 
Wasted a bunch of time on ProcessMonitor but I cannot tell where/how MSPaint saves this information.

Ctrl+E is the shortcut to open image properties
